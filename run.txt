# 5 Prozesse mit physikalischem Speicher von 8 Rahmen
# <time> <PID> <action> <action> ...          
# for each point in time a list of actions for the same process may be specified
# possible entires for actions are: 
#	S for start
# 	E for end i.e. termination of the process, yielding in freeing all occupied frames
#	Rx use of the page with the given number x for read-access
#	Wx use of the page with the given number x for read-access
#
# Caution:	Each action in this file refers to the use of an entire page, not a single memory access
#			For stimulus-creation keep in mind that the duration of processes must be long enough to 
#			allow realistic use of the statistics of the page-access. The statistics are updated in the 
#			background in the timer-interrupt callback handler, which is only triggered every TIMER_INTERVAL ticks. 
# 
# file must be ordered by ascending time stamps
